I created An interactive contact form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which includes:

-📧 Validation for email addresses
- ✅ Required fields check
- 📝 Proper input formatting
- 
Error messages are displayed for invalid submissions, and a success message appears upon successful submission.
It was a great learning experience, enhancing user interaction and ensuring data integrity.
